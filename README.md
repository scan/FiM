## The Language

This Interpreter was inspired by [this](http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/10/editorial-fim-pony-programming-language.html#more) post on EqD. I have taken some liberties at the language whereever the specification was too unspecified.

## FiM++ Interpreter

The interpreter itself is a JavaScript that can be used on any website, or via [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Included is a [express](http://expressjs.com/) mini-server to run the example site.
